(EXTRA) Bowling exercise

## Explanation

You own a bowling area. People come to your place to play bowling. You've been managing everything with paper and pen but the number of people coming has skyrocketed. you need a better approach.
A database :) !!!!! (what a surprise ... ¬¬')

## Requirements

Create a database that provides a solution for the following requirements:

- As a manager (MA), I want to set up the available bowling-courts (BC) based on dates.
- As a bowling player (BP), I want to see the available BC base on dates.
- As a BP, I want to book a BC for a specific date and time (1h, 2h, ...)
- As a MA, I want to make a BC available/unavailable for maintenance purposes.
  - I should be able to specify an end-of-maintenance date.
  - How would you "manage" the bookings that might be affected?
- As a MA, I want to accept/deny bookings for specific BC and dates.
  - If a booking is denied, what do you think would happen?
